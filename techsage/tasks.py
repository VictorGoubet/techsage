                    platforms that require account creation (e.g., Crunchbase).
                    - Prioritize the following sources:
                    - The company's official website
                    - Legal and regulatory sources (e.g., Infogreffe, EDGAR Search)
                    - Wikipedia
                    - Blogs and reputable news sites

                    about other companies with similar names.

                - **Weird Data**: Identify and flag any data that appears unusual or out of place, such as unknown
                cities, misspelled names, or other anomalies.
                - **Inconsistent Data**: Ensure all data points are logically consistent. For example, check for
                mismatches like a country listed as France but a city listed as New York, or financial figures that
                do not match the number of employees (e.g., 1B revenue but 0 employees).
                - **Proper Formatting**: Ensure all data is properly formatted, including well-capitalized names,
                no double spaces, no weird characters, and standardized formats for phone numbers, addresses, etc.

                Guidelines:
                - Remove any data that is flagged as inaccurate or inconsistent.
                - Correct minor formatting issues where possible.
                - Ensure the final dataset is clean, consistent, and properly formatted.
